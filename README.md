# Intercom-User-Generator v1.0
A simple Sinatra UI that wraps and automates API requests to create users and conversations on an Intercom instance.

### Notes:
1. Put this together quickly and it's currently hosted on a free Heroku Dyno. As a result, no static files.

2. No error catching / form validation.
